Every open source project dreams of being able to take on its wings and become successful. But we know these projects need effort, time and above all the funding to help support the dreams of people who started it.
<br>
When we started working on TinyML, we started with a vision to democratise TinyML education. 
We are constantly surrounded by IoT devices, from smartphones to watches to even smart ovens. As AI enters every aspect of our lives, it becomes vital to understand how neural networks work on tiny devices like microcontrollers or smartphones.
<br>
In the first study group we hosted, we covered a range of topics, like optimisation techniques, hardware devices and research directions in TinyML. 
We quickly came to realise that most of the people starting out in the field did not have access to microcontrollers to experiment and practice on!
<br>
We ideated a hardware library that people can use and carry it forward. I think this will be a great community effort to bring about TinyML education to everyone who wants to learn.Along with the hardware, we will also have a software framework: scaledown to get you rocking and rolling with your first TinyML project!
<br>
*With that introduction, we are happy to announce "Our project is very fortunate to be funded by No Starch Press Foundation this year"
Wohoo!!*

Our project has two main pillars, Education and Framework. Through this process, Education will feed into the Framework, The hardware library will help you build your first project using the framework. Once you implement your projects, you can also be part of our Education in the community. 
<br>
With this,we hope to reach and increase TinyML education in our community too. 
<br>
This field has definitely been hardware dependent, but we are trying to solve this by setting up hardware libraries near you. So reach out to us, if you want to start a hardware library in your city! We would love to help you set up and provide hardwares to support this! 
<br>
If a hardware library does not interest you but you still want to be founding members building and supporting this project? Fill up this form and we will reach back to you!

<b>We are truly grateful to NSPF for their grant in getting this project off the ground.</b>
I think most of us have ideas to help the community and organisations at NSPF give us hope that every idea no matter how crazy you think out there, has a chance to be funded!
